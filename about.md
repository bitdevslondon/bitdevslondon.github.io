London BitDevs is a community of Bitcoin enthusiasts and professionals
interested in discussing and participating in the research and development of
Bitcoin and related protocols. We're a friendly and inclusive group, and all
are welcome to join us to learn about Bitcoin.

### Socratic Seminars

Our monthly Socratic Seminar events are formatted to foster debate, information
sharing and lively discussion. In the weeks preceding the event, discussion
topics are collated by meetup members from a variety of sources: pull requests
in popular git repositories (e.g. Bitcoin Core, lnd, c-lightning, Joinmarket,
Elements Alpha and Electrum), research papers, technical blog posts, IRC logs,
network monitors and more. To complete the meeting, members present open source
projects, companies, research and other relevant materials. A feedback and Q&A
section follow. After the event the group gathers at a nearby venue to
socialize.

A newsletter is sent out the day of the event which outlines discussion topics.
Archives of discussion topics and presentations can be found in the event
descriptions of past meetups. The discussion portion of the event is never
recorded. Discussion is technical, but there should be something for everyone -
whether this is your first or one-hundredth BitDevs meetup, you should learn
something new!

Please contact the organizers through the meetup page if you'd like to present
at a future Socratic event or have a recommended topic for discussion. There
are different requirements for presentations depending on the nature of the
project.
